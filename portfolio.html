  <h1>   For the 1.1.9 Project we created a game. The objective of the game is to move your starting dot through all of the squares and raech the end in the most efficient way possible. We made it so the starting and end point is randomly generated as well as the obstacles are randomly generated. We put all of this onto a grid system and made it so arrow keys moved your character through on square of the grid. After you go through all the obstacles/squares and reach the end, the squares turn green and you win!</h1>
